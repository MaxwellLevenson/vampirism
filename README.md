# Vampirism
Vampirism is a mod for Dota 2 based on the 'Vampirism Fire' map for Warcraft III. Human players gather resources and defend themselves agains powerful vampires who are seeking to convert all humans into vampires.

Please bear in mind that the mod is currently in **beta** and that there are likely bugs which may prevent you from completing a full game.

If you experience any bugs, feel free to submit an issue if it is not currently tracked, but please include as much detail and a reproduction of your bug in order to assure that it can be identified and fixed.

## Differences

There are many differences from the original map, players of the original map would be advised to familiarize themselves with them before jumping into a game.

- Workers

Worker AI works differently than it does in the original. The goal is to minimize the movement made by workers, in order to reduce the bandwidth required to host the game. This means that workers
now 'lock' in place after reaching their first harvesting location and cannot move from then on. Players will need to build houses within 300 range of a worker in order for it to drop off its lumber.

- Slayers

Slayers are not a 'hero' by default, and as such will not be hotkeyed by default.

- Cancelling upgrades

Buildings do not have a cancel ability, however they may be cancelled during any upgrade by issuing a 'Stop' command to break the channeling upgrade. ('S' is the default hotkey for this).
